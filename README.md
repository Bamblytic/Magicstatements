# Magic Statements SQL Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of magic SQL statements within a Python environment to interact with SQLite databases.

## Overview

- Uses the `ipython-sql` extension to run SQL queries in notebook cells.
- Connects to a local SQLite database `SQLiteMagic.db`.
- Contains SQL commands to create tables, insert data, and query databases interactively.
- Demonstrates data manipulation and retrieval using SQL inside Jupyter.

## Features

- Installation and setup of required packages (`ipython-sql`, `prettytable`).
- Loading and configuring SQL extensions for notebook use.
- Examples of creating tables and inserting multiple rows of test data.
- Execution of various SQL queries with results displayed inline.
- Practical usage of mixing Python and SQL for data analysis workflows.

## Usage

1. Ensure Jupyter Notebook environment is installed.
2. Open `Magicstatements.ipynb`.
3. Run cells sequentially to install dependencies, connect to the database, create tables, insert data, and execute queries.
4. Modify SQL statements or database connections as needed for custom datasets.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Python 3.x
- Packages: `ipython-sql`, `prettytable`, `sqlite3` (standard library)
